when moving the character you 'lock' 16 pixels movement.
for 16 frames you scroll each frame in the same direction.
1 pixel per frame.
During these 16 frames the new screen is build up by simply copying tiles (from rom->vram or vram->vram, some tiles are just pure white and can be copied with a fill instruction)

main character could be copied with copy instruction at vblank (copy from rom->active page) (character is the within a white rectangle so you can copy the rectangle in total)
enemies are hardware sprites
